# Jekyll Boilerplate
My Jekyll boilerplate for a simple blog site for documenting my personal learning journey. Utilizing the minimal-mistakes-jekyll theme.

<br/>

**NOTE BEFORE PROCEEDING:**
> *I am still navigating **Jekyll**, the **Liquid** templating language and the **minimal-mistakes-jekyll** theme, so this boilerplate will be incredibly basic. For more configuration info, please see the [Useful info](#useful-info) section.*

<br/>

Here is a [demo](https://gpoliko.github.io/jekyll-boilerplate/) of the site.
